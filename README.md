Splunk Log Analysis on Kali Linux

## Description
The following will show the steps, along with screenshots, of the steps I took to complete the project:

## Languages
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Resources
- [Splunk Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/)
- [Kali Linux Documentation](https://www.kali.org/docs/)
- [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/)

## Utilities Used
- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms)
- [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/)

## Explanation

This project involved setting up Splunk on Kali Linux to analyze logs from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. 

After installing Splunk and configuring it to recognize the log files, various queries were executed to extract insights, including counting unique carriers and filtering by region. 

This demonstrates the application of Splunk's powerful data analysis capabilities in a security-focused environment.
